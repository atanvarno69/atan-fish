# Fish Recipe

Adds a configurable recipe to craft fish.

Settings provided to control:

* Choose between crafting in an assembling machine or chemical plant
* The amount of fish produced per craft
* The amount of fish required per craft
* The amount of water required per craft
* The recipe crafting time

The recipe is unlocked by the technology that unlocks the selected crafting machine: Automation 2 for assembling machine 2, or Oil processing for chemical plant.

Productivity modules may not be used with the fish recipe.

No additional assets or production chains are added.

## But why?

One of my other mods, [Wood Recipe](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/atan-wood), exists to enable automation of wood production. In the base game, fish is the only other item that can't be automated *easily* (you can automate fish in a rocket silo by [launching space science](https://wiki.factorio.com/Raw_fish)). If you really want to automate spidertron production, manual fishing is unacceptable.

I like to automate, so I made this mod.

## Alternatives

Other mods for fish production exist. Just a few good options are [Xenos Oppression: Breed fish by feeding fish with fish](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/fish-production-cycle) and [Nihilistzsche_FishFarm](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Nihilistzsche_FishFarm).

These add a dedicated fish production building. If you just want to craft fish without adding any additional assets, this mod is for you.

[No Fish In Spidertron](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/NoFishInSpidertron) is probably a more sensible way to automate spidertron production.

## Space Age Incompatibility

This mod is incompatibile with Space Age as it includes its own method for fish production.
